## Deployed version

the deployed version is run through vercel through this link`https://todo-app-six-swart.vercel.app/`
For the deployed version, I only created a local setup for the mock api db serveris so you need to run your local version so that it would work on the server using `npm start` or by running the json-server `json-server --watch db.json --port 4000`
